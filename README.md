### Running the Program

View.Main class: 

Data files needed: 

Interesting data files:
    fire.xml:
    fireDefault.xml:
    
Features implemented: 

* Simulation
    1. Allow a variety of grid location shapes(Square, Hexagon)
    2. Allow a variety of grid edge types(finite, toroidal)
    3. Implement additional simulations(Rock, Papers and Scissors)

* Configuration
    1. Implement error checking for incorrect file data
    2. Allow simulations initial configuration to be set by randomly based on probability/concentration distributions
    3. Allow users to save the current state of the simulation as an XML configuration file

* Visualization
    1. Display a graph of the populations of all of the "kinds" of cells over the time of the simulation
    2. Allow users to interact with the simulation dynamically to change the values of its parameters
    3. Allow users to run multiple simulations at the same time so they can compare the results side by side
    (We made the decision to make each simulation independent from each other. So, users can add different
    types of simulations and control each simulation individually. Each individual simulation will have its own 
    UI control. We made this decision because it gives users maximum amount of flexibility over what they 
    want to do with simulations. We also )

Assumptions or Simplifications:
    
Known Bugs:

Extra credit:

1. Our program supports multiple languages: english and simplified chinese
    
2. Warning dialogs will appear if user enters invalid output or if the data file they choose 
    does not follow the specified format
    
3. You can change the size of the grid dynamically through the width and height input field;

4. Not only can you add new simulation, you can also remove the added simulation if necessary;

5. Auto-check input: You can only enter numerical values into the text input fields. Other characters entered
will be automatically trim.

### Notes

* Note that the program supports adding as many simulation as you like. However, due to 

* When you first run the application, the simulation area may be empty or already completed. 
This is because the simulation has already occurred before it got rendered on the screen before
Just press reset button to see its simulation.

* You have to press apply button in order for the change you enter in the input fields
to be effective

* Pressing the reset button will reset the simulation to its 
initial state and pause it. So, you have to either press start 
or step to continue the simulation again.
